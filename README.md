# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systemic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to develop and maintain high-quality software systems. Involves designs, development, and maintenance of software products
Importance - Enables creating software applications and systems that power modern life, communications, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering
The development of programming language that is Fortan C
Software engineering was set as a discipline in the 1960s
The advent of structured programming in the 1970s
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements - the gathering and documenting of user needs and system requirements
Design - The creation of high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interfaces
Testing - Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements
Deployment - Releasing the software to users and customers
Maintenance - This is by providing support updates and enhancements to the software after deployment
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a sequential approach with distinct phases (e.g., requirements, design, implementation) flowing downward like a waterfall. It can be used in large-scale infrastructure and regulated industries such as health care, finance, and aerospace
Agile is an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change. It is used in Software development with evolving requirements and Web and app development 
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer- Writes code and implements software solutions
Quality Assurance Engineer - Checks software quality by designing and executing test plans
Project manager - Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Envirinments - provides comprehensive tools for writing debugging and testing code eg Visual Studio Eclipse 
Version Control Systems helps in tracking changes in source code and coordinating work among team members e.g Git and Subversion
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Change of requirements during the development cycle leading to scope creep and project delays
Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality
Technical debts accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions that impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs 
Strategies to overcome
Effective communication
Agile methodologies
Prioritization of tasks
Regular reassessment of project goals and timelines
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing - it is testing individual components or modules of software 
Integration testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems
System testing - Testing the entire system as a whole
Acceptance Testing - Testing software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is crafting questions or statements to get the best positive responses from AI models . It is giving clear instructions to a very smart assisstant
It helps avoid getting a confused answer by asking clear and specific questions
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Tell me about Cows
Show me the different types of cows 
This will make the AI answer the different types of cows
